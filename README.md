MTH343 Projections, Subspaces, Orthogonality, and QR Decomposition:

-Explored orthogonality and how to use it in order to describe matrices and solve least squares.

-Used least squares and QR in order to try and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

-Improved the least squares classifier by implementing it as a binary classifier, took a vector for each category then used Q and R to
