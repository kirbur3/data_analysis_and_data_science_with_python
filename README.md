MTH343 Projections, Subspaces, Orthogonality, and QR Decomposition:

-Explored orthogonality and how to use it in order to describe matrices and solve least squares.

-Used least squares and QR in order to try and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

-Improved the least squares classifier by implementing it as a binary classifier, took a vector for each category then used the matrices Q and R to solve the least squares problem for x for each of these vectors. In the end, got a resulting prediction, compared the predicted labels with the actual labels, and calculated the prediction accuracy.

MTH371 Arnoldi Algorithm and Eigenvalues Project:

-Wrote a python function implementing the Arnoldi algorithm.

-Computed the eigenvalues of matrices.

-Compared the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the matrices.

-Tested the function with different matrices.

MTH371 Gauss-Seidel Method and L1-smoother Project:

-Wrote an iterative algorithm for solving Ax=b for a given sparse s.p.d. matrix A stored in csr format.

-Made: lower and upper matrices, a forward substitution function, a backward substitution function, a L1-smoother function, and a function that makes a regular Diagonal matrix.

-Made: the diagonal matrix representing the L1-smoother, the forward Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix, the backward Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix and the symmetric Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix.
